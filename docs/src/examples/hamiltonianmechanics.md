## Hamiltonian Mechanics

In this section we present applications of reachability computations in the subdomain
of physics that is known as classical mechanics.

Recall that the time evolution of a classical mechanical system is governed by the solution
of [Hamilton's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics),

```math
\frac{dp}{dt} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q},~\frac{dq}{dt} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p}.
```
where ```H = H(p, q, t)``` is the Hamiltonian, which often corresponds to the total
energy of the system.

In the rest of this section we make the rechability computation.

## Spring-mass system

```math
V(q) = \dfrac{kq^2}{2}
```

## Cubic potential

V(q) = A / 2 * (q[1]^2 + q[2]^2) + B / âˆš2 * q[1] * (3 * q[2]^2 - q[1]^2) + D / 4 * (q[1]^2 + q[2]^2)^2;
